# SMART SEND 

Version 0.2.0 (Updated June, 2020)
This project needs a better name.

*Disclosure*  This script utilizes webscraping/webcrawling, which may violate terms of conditions or local laws.
This repository and its owning contributor are not responsible for the actions of those that utilize this codebase.

### Current Functionality

* Ingest scraped data from a sample of news sources.  Specifically, headlines of news articles.
* Insert data to sqlite3 database.
* Run sentiment analysis, utilizing pretrained model, to identify sentiment score.
* Aggregate scores for the script run and send via Twilio SMS API.
*Not an NLP expert, so aggregating compound NLP scores by mean is the default*

### Upcoming Features

* Ability to receive SMS for stock tickers.
1. Scrape news articles for sentiment of ticker.
2. Retrieve houring moving average of ticker price.
3. Send aggregate sentiment and moving average slope.
4. *Add webhook (probably AWS Lambda) for Twilio HTTP callbacks.*
* Add news sources (and pivot to APIs where possible).
* Add multiprocessing for remaining scrapers.
* Create notification for drastic pivots in overall sentiment.

## Required Changes
* Finish "Upcoming Features" tasks.
* Rename variables.
* Add proper tests.
* Clean up and/or add in-code comments.
